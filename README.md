# Passhole
It's a hole... for passwords!

If you're like me, and you probably aren't, the idea of using a closed source password safe scares you.  Also, you have a terrible memory.  So I wrote this little PHP application.  Instead of remembering dozens of strong passwords for many different sites, you only remember one.  Easy, right?

See the WIKI for installation instructions.
